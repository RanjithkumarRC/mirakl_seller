                <p>Our Connector App has smart pre-built API connection that takes the pain out of consuming custom platform integrations to handle different Seller Catalog Data like product, offers and let customers place the orders and hold unified management of products, orders etc. within the app.</p>
                <p>Here is the step-by-step guide to manage categories, products and order sync up from Mirakl to BigCommerce store. After the app is installed, the app is ready to use.</p>

                        <p>Once the ‘RC Marketplace Connector’ app gets installed, you should see the ‘Mirakl and BC Configuration Form.</p>
